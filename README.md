a) To display word with the longest length
b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

a) Addition of two matrices
b) Subtraction of two matrices
c) Multiplication of two matrices
d) Transpose of a matrix

ASSIGNMENT-4 => GROUP B ASSIGNMENT NO. 12 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
a) Write a python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted
order on names. Search your friend from list using binary search (recursive and nonrecursive). Insert friend if not present in phonebook
b) Write a python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted
order on names. Search your friend from list using Fibonacci search. Insert friend if not
present in phonebook.

ASSIGNMENT-5 => GROUP B ASSIGNMENT NO. 14 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Write a pythonprogram to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function
for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Selection Sort
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores

ASSIGNMENT-6 => GROUP B ASSIGNMENT NO. 15 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Write a python program to store second year percentage of students in array. Write
function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Insertion sort
b) Shell Sort and display top five scores


ASSIGNMENT-7 => GROUP C ASSIGNMENT NO. 19 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students
of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request.
Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of
club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club
member‘s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write
functions to:
a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b) Compute total number of members of club
c) Display members
d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

ASSIGNMENT-8 => GROUP C ASSIGNMENT NO. 23 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Write C++ program for storing binary number using doubly linked lists. Write functions 
a) To compute 1‘s and 2‘s complement
b) Add two binary numbers

ASSIGNMENT-9 => GROUP D ASSIGNMENT NO. 25 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically,
punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop”
is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and
observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a
palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the
original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with
functionsa) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

ASSIGNMENT-10 => GROUP D ASSIGNMENT NO. 27 =>
PROBLEM STAEMENT :-
Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation
using stack based on given conditions:
1. Operands and operator, both must be single character.
2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
3. Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

ASSIGNMENT-11 => GROUP E ASSIGNMENT NO. 29 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.

ASSIGNMENT-12 => GROUP E ASSIGNMENT NO. 32 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served
basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system
using circular queue using array

ASSIGNMENT-13 => GROUP E ASSIGNMENT NO. 31 =>
PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be
made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a onedimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and
delete elements from either end of the deque
